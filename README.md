# Zowie iOS SDK

[![Swift 5.3 Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-5.3-green.svg)](https://github.com/apple/swift) [![Swift 5.3 Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-12+-orange.svg)](https://apple.com)

## Installation

### Cocoapods

Add `pod ZowieSDK` to your Podfile

```
pod ZowieSDK
```

To support dependencies that Zowie uses, add the following code at the end of your `Podfile`

```
post_install do |installer|
  installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
    if ["Apollo", "Apollo/WebSocket", "Kingfisher", "lottie-ios"].include? target.name
      target.build_configurations.each do |config|
        config.build_settings['BUILD_LIBRARY_FOR_DISTRIBUTION'] = 'YES'
      end
    end
  end
end
```

## Usage

### Initialization

To be able to use Zowie SDK first of all you have to provide the configuration:

```swift
let configuration = ZowieConfiguration(
    instanceId: "INSTANCE_ID",
    authType: .anonymous,
    chatHost: "CHAT_HOST"
)

Zowie.shared.set(configuration: configuration)
```

\***\*Remember, you won't be able to use ANY of SDK functionalities without a proper configuration setup, so be sure you provide it.\*\***

You can clear anonymous session with `Zowie.shared.clearAnonymousSession(forInstanceId: "INSTANCEID)`. If your integration requires token authentication you can replace `.anonymous` with `.token`.

### Chat UI

You can access Chat UI from `ZowieChatViewController`. Use it just like a regular view controller, so it's up to you how you want to put it in your stack. For example, you can show it from a different view controller:

```swift
let chatViewController = ZowieChatViewController()
navigationController?.pushViewController(chatViewController, animated: true)
```

### Chat initialization error

If you want to handle the chat initialization error, use:

```swift
Zowie.shared.onChatInitializationError = { error in
    // Do someting
}
```

### Setting user metadata

You can set needed user metadata. All those fields are optional.

```swift
let metadata = ZowieMetadata(
    firstName: "first",
    lastName: "last",
    name: "name",
    locale: "locale",
    timeZone: "timeZone",
    phoneNumber: "123456789",
    email: "email@email.com",
    extraParams: ["custom": "value"]
)
Zowie.shared.set(metadata: metadata)
```

### Setting a referral value
```swift
/// Sets a referral value for the conversation.
///
/// - Parameters:
///   - referral: A `String` representing the referral information to be set.
///   - completion: A closure that is called upon completion of the operation. The closure provides a `ZowieReferralStatus`
///                 which indicates the outcome of setting the referral:
///       - `.failure(ZowieError)`: The operation failed, with the associated `ZowieError` providing details about the error.
///       - `.waiting`: The referral has been accepted and will be sent during the next chat initialization.
///       - `.success`: The operation completed successfully and the referral was set immediately.
Zowie.shared.set(referral: "VALUE") { status in
    // status handling
}
```


### FCM notifications

To receive FCM notifications you have to provide `deviceToken`

```swift
Zowie.shared.set(fcmToken: "token") { result in
    // Completion handler is optional
}
```

This will allow us to send push notifications to the user's device. Remember that you have set up all required notification-related permissions.

If you want to disable notifications, use:

```swift
Zowie.shared.disableNotifications() { result in
    // Completion handler is optional
}
```

### Context

You can feed backend with the `contextId`

```swift
Zowie.shared.set(contextId: "contextId") { result in
    // Completion handler is optional
}
```

## Customization

### Layout

```swift
let config = ZowieLayoutConfiguration(showConsultantAvatar: false, consultantNameMode: .firstName)
Zowie.shared.set(layoutConfiguration: config)
```

### Localization

The only supported language in this SDK is `english`. If you need more localization please provide it as below:

```swift
let strings = ZowieStrings(
    messagePlaceholder: "string",
    sendFailureErrorMessage: "string",
    tryAgain: "string",
    delivered: "string",
    read: "string",
    attachment: "string",
    disconnectMessage: "string",
    reconnectMessage: "string",
    historyErrorMessage: "string"
)

Zowie.shared.set(strings: strings)
```

### Colors

Feel free to set up color branding however you like with help of `Zowie.shared.set(colors: colors)`

### URL handling

By default, Zowie SDK opens URLs using an external web browser. You can provide custom handling

```swift
Zowie.shared.set(urlHandler: { url, source in
    // Return false if you want to handle URL by yourself
    return false
})
```
