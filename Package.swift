        // The exact pin is required: the binary calls LiveKit through vtable slots fixed at our
        // build time, so another version links fine and then crashes — verified, 2.17.0 dies on
        // entering voice chat. It therefore moves only together with a new binary. Lifted by the
        // follow-up that ships the LiveKit-facing file as source, compiled against the app's own
        // version.
